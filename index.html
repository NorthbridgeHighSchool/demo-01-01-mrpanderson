    <h1>Olivia's Day</h1>
    <p>This morning I wokeup around 6:45. I watched some Youtube and rolled out of bed. I went to the bathroom and brushed my teeth. Now it was time to start the school day!</p>
    <p>I rushed to my room to grab the necessities. My laptop, the charger, my notebook, and of course my fuzzy blanket. I ran downstairs and plugged everything in.</p>
    <p>For breakfast, since I only had a couple minutes, I grabbed a Kind bar from my pantry. I then sat on the couch, watched some Youtube, and munched on my lovely breakfast. Now here we are.</p>
